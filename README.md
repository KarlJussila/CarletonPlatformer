# CarletonPlatformer
This is a simple 2D platformer that I made with a friend at the Carleton SCSI program in 2018 for our final project. It was made in python with pygame, and it includes a level editor and a few simple levels. The objective in each level is to get to the gold.

Pygame is a very minimal game engine, so we had to implement collisions and movement and other simple mechanics from scratch.

### Installation
- Install Python 3
- Install pygame with pip
- Run main.py with Python 3
